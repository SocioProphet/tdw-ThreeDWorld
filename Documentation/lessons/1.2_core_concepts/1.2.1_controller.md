# 1.2.1 The Controller

A controller is the Python object that communicates with the simulation application (the build). Typically, users are responsible for writing their own controllers, though the documentation for TDW includes numerous examples.

You've already seen a minimal controller script example:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

This will launch the build and immediately kill the process.

In many cases, you'll want to add your own functions to a controller. To do this, create a child class of `Controller`:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

class MyController(Controller):
    pass
```

This example will print all of the commands sent to the build:

```python
from typing import Union, List
from tdw.controller import Controller

class MyController(Controller):
    def communicate(self, commands: Union[dict, List[dict]]) -> list:
        print(commands)
        return super().communicate(commands=commands)
```
