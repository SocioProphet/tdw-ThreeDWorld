# 1.2.2 Scenes

A **scene** is a static environment in a TDW simulation. It usually contains objects such as an empty room, outdoor terrain, etc. It might include additional objects such as trees, houses, etc., but these objects are also static (they can't be moved or adjusted). Scenes can contain [objects](objects.md), [avatars](avatars.md), and other non-static entities.

For most of the [TDW Command API](commands.md) to work, you must add a scene to the simulation. There can never be more than one scene in TDW; loading a new scene will discard the previous scene.

There are several ways to load a scene in TDW:

## 1. Procedurally generate an indoor environment

Creating a procedurally-generated interior scene (often abbreviated to "proc-gen room") in TDW includes at least two steps:

1. Send the [`load_scene` command](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/master/Documentation/api/command_api.md#load_scene) or call `c.start()`:

2. Send the [`create_exterior_walls` command](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/master/Documentation/api/command_api.md#create_exterior_walls). This command can be difficult to use, so TDW includes a wrapper function called `TDWUtils.create_empty_room(width, length)` that will create an empty room.

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
```

This controller will this scene:

**Note: The scene won't be actually be visible.** The next tutorial page will cover how to add rendering to TDW.

## 2. Download and load a streamed scene

TDW includes many pre-generated photorealistic scenes. These scenes exist on a remote Amazon S3 server as ***asset bundles***, which are Unity3D-specific binary files that can be loaded into a Unity3D application (e.g. the TDW build) at runtime. To access a scene asset bundle, TDW downloads the scene into active memory (not to a local file).

Scene asset bundles can be quite large; expect downloads to require up to several minutes. When a scene is loaded into TDW, the previous scene (if any) is discarded from memory; if you want to use it again, TDW will need to re-download it.
