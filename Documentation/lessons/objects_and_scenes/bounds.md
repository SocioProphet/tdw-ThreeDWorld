# `Bounds` output data

[As noted earlier,](../core_concepts/objects.md) the object position returned by [`Transforms` output data](../../api/output_data.md#Transforms) is the **bottom-center** of the object. To get the *center* of the object, you need to request [`Bounds` output data](../../api/output_data.md#Bounds)
