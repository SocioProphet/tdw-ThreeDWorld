##### Virtual Reality (VR)

# Overview

It is possible for a human to interact with a TDW scene using virtual reality (VR).

## Requirements

- Windows
- A powerful GPU

## Hardware-specific requirements

Currently, TDW supports only Oculus rigs with Touch controllers. [Read this for more information.](oculus_touch.md) For an Oculus VR setup, you need:

- An Oculus headset (Rift, Rift S, Quest, or Quest 2)
- An Oculus link cable
- Oculus Touch controllers

## VR hardware, rigs, and agents

- **VR hardware** refers to the physical devices needed for a VR simulation.
- A **VR rig** is a virtual body i.e. simulated hands and head plus the code required to track the rig's position, to pick up objects, and so on. In TDW, a controller adds a VR rig to the scene and thereafter the rig communicates directly with the build.
- A **VR agent** is the human operating the VR hardware and embodying the VR rig.

## VR commands and add-ons

All VR rigs share some common commands and have unique commands as well. To simplify the setup process, each VR rig has a separate add-on.
