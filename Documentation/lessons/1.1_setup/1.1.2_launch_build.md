# 1.1.2 Auto-launching the TDW build

By default, a TDW controller will automatically launch a build when it runs. It will also automatically update the TDW build if it detects an out of date version:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
```

To kill the build process, add a `terminate` command:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

**However, the build won't work if auto-launched on a Linux server.** This is because it's too difficult to automatically predict the display settings of a server. If you try running the previous example controller snippets on a Linux server, they won't work.

Instead, you must set the `launch_build` parameter to `False`:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller(launch_build=False)
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

Then, download an extract the [latest version of the build](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/releases/latest/).

You can set `launch_build=False` on a personal computer as well (in which case you'll need to download the build manually; see the previous link).

All of the code snippets in these tutorials are set up to automatically launch the build. If you want to try running them on a Linux server, just remember to add `launch_build=False` to the controller constructor.
