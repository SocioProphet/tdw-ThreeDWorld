##### Human user interaction

# Overview

TDW offers two different ways for human users to interact with a simulation, available on certain platforms:

| Method                           | Windows | OS X | Linux personal computer | Linux server |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ---- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| [Keyboard controls](keyboard.md) | Yes     | Yes  | Yes                     | No           |
| [Virtual reality (VR)](vr.md)    | Yes     | Yes  | No                      | No           |

We consider keyboard to be "complete" feature, while we intend to upgrade VR support in the near future.
