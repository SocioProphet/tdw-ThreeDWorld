# Procedural object arrangements

In [`ProcGenKitchen`](proc_gen_kitchen.md), objects are grouped into pseduo-atomic "arrangements". Each arrangement is procedurally generated. For example, a single kitchen counter with objects on top of the counter and inside the cabinet is generated via a [`KitchenCounter`](../../python/proc_gen/arrangements/kitchen_counter.md) arrangement.
