# How to upgrade from TDW v1.8 to v1.9

## Read the changelog

[Read this](../Changelog.md) for a complete list of changes. TDW v1.9 introduces *many* changes; this document only covers cases in which you might need to adjust existing code.

## 1. Added: Add-ons

[Add-ons](../python/api/add_ons) are a new feature to TDW that will automatically inject commands into every `communicate([])` call. They are very useful for commonplace tasks such as image capture as well as managing agent code.

Add-ons don't *replace* any existing functionality in TDW; they merely *reorganize* it. We recommend upgrading your code to use add-ons, but add-ons are never a *necessary* aspect of TDW.

## 2. Rewrote documentation

All non-API documentation has been completely rewritten. 

## 1. Changes to `Controller`

### A. Removed `Controller.start()`

This function used to send a command to initialize a scene in TDW. Now, that command is sent automatically in the Controller constructor.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
```

### B. Removed `Controller.load_streamed_scene(scene)`

This function hasn't been the preferred way to load a stream scene for a while now because it doesn't let you send additional commands on the same frame. We recommend using `Controller.get_add_scene(scene_name)` instead.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.load_streamed_scene(scene="tdw_room")
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.communicate(c.get_add_scene(scene_name="tdw_room"))
```

### C. Removed `Controller.add_object(model_name)`

This function hasn't been the preferred way to add an object for a while now because it doesn't let you send additional commands on the same frame. We recommend using `Controller.get_add_object(scene_name)` instead.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
object_id = c.add_object(model_name="iron_box")
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                object_id=c.get_unique_id())])
```

### D. Removed all librarian fields and replaced them with class variables

This allows cached librarians to be accessible outside of the controller.

`self.model_librarian` has been replaced with `Controller.MODEL_LIBRARIANS`, a dictionary that is automatically populated as libraries are added. Likewise, `self.scene_librarian` has been replaced with `Controller.SCENE_LIBRARIANS` and so on.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                library="models_core.json",
                                object_id=c.get_unique_id())])
print(c.model_librarian.library) # Path to models_core.json
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
print(Controller.MODEL_LIBRARIANS.keys()) # dict_keys([])
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                library="models_core.json",
                                object_id=c.get_unique_id())])
print(Controller.MODEL_LIBRARIANS.keys()) # dict_keys(['models_core.json'])
```

### E. Removed `check_build_process` in the `Controller` constructor

This was introduced in v1.8 and ended up not being that useful; it also slows down the controller too much to be practical.

***

## 2. Other changes to the `tdw` module

### A. Replaced `FloorplanController` with `Floorplan` add-on

The `Floorplan` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`FloorplanController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.floorplan_controller import FloorplanController

c = FloorplanController()
c.communicate(c.get_scene_init_commands(scene="1a", layout=0))
```

`Floorplan` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.floorplan import Floorplan

c = Controller()
f = Floorplan()
f.init_scene(scene="1a", layout=0)
c.add_ons.append(f)
c.communicate([])
```

### B. Replaced `DebugController` with `Debug` add-on

The `Debug` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`DebugController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.debug_controller import DebugController
c = DebugController()
c.start()
```

`Debug` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.debug import Debug

c = Controller()
c.add_ons.append(Debug(record=True, path="out"))
c.communicate([])
```

### C. Replaced `KeyboardController` with `Keyboard` add-on

The `Keyboard` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`KeyboardController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.keyboard_controller import KeyboardController

def stop():
    global done
    done = True
    c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})

done = False
c = KeyboardController()
c.start()

c.listen(key="esc", function=stop)

while not done:
    c.communicate([])
```

`Keyboard` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.keyboard import Keyboard

def stop():
    global done
    done = True
    c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
    
done = False
c = Controller()

keyboard = Keyboard()
keyboard.listen(key="esc", function=stop)
c.add_ons.append(keyboard)

while not done:
    c.communicate([])
```

### E. Removed `TransformInitData`, `RigidbodyInitData`, and `AudioInitData`

These were tricky to use and unintuitive (because `AudioInitData` didn't actually load any audio data). They have been replaced with `Controller.get_add_physics_object()`.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.object_init_data import AudioInitData


c = Controller()
c.start()
commands = [TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
a = AudioInitData(name="rh10",
                  position={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                  rotation={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0})
object_id, object_commands = a.get_commands()
commands.extend(object_commands)
c.communicate(commands)
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
object_id = c.get_unique_id()
commands = [TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
commands.extend(c.get_add_physics_object(model_name="rh10",
                                         position={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                                         rotation={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                                         object_id=object_id))
c.communicate(commands)
```

***

## 4. Changes to the Command API

### A. Removed `set_proc_gen_reflection_probe`

This has been replaced with `enable_reflection_probes`.

### B. Renamed `send_environments` to `send_scene_regions`

This change was made because the idiom of multiple environments no longer meaningfully exists in TDW; there are scenes, and scenes have one or more rectangular regions.

Additionally, renamed `Environments` output data (ID `"envi"`) to `SceneRegions` (ID `"sreg"`)

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Environments

c = Controller()
resp = c.communicate([c.get_add_scene(scene_name="floorplan_1a"),
                      {"$type": "send_environments"}])
for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "envi":
        environments = Environments(resp[i])
        for j in range(environments.get_num()):
            environment_id = environments.get_id(j)
            environment_center = environments.get_center(j)
            environment_bounds = environments.get_bounds(j)
            print(environment_id, environment_center, environment_bounds)
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, SceneRegions

c = Controller()
resp = c.communicate([c.get_add_scene(scene_name="floorplan_1a"),
                      {"$type": "send_scene_regions"}])
for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "sreg":
        scene_regions = SceneRegions(resp[i])
        for j in range(scene_regions.get_num()):
            region_id = scene_regions.get_id(j)
            region_center = scene_regions.get_center(j)
            region_bounds = scene_regions.get_bounds(j)
            print(region_id, region_center, region_bounds)
```

### C. Split rigidbody output data into dynamic data and static data

Previously, `Rigidbodies` output data included  dynamic data such as velocity that can change per-frame and static data such as mass that isn't expected to change per frame.

Now, that data has been split into dynamic and static output data types. `Rigidbodies` contains dynamic data and can be requested with `send_rigidbodies`. `StaticRigidbodies` contains static data and can be requested with `send_static_rigidbodies`.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Rigidbodies

c = Controller()
c.start()
resp = c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
                      c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                       position={"x": 0, "y": 3, "z": 0},
                                       object_id=c.get_unique_id()),
                      {"$type": "send_rigidbodies",
                       "frequency": "always"}])

for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "rigi":
        rigi = Rigidbodies(resp[i])
        for j in range(rigi.get_num()):
            object_id = rigi.get_id(j)
            velocity = rigi.get_velocity(j)
            angular_velocity = rigi.get_angular_velocity(j)
            sleeping = rigi.get_sleeping(j)
            mass = rigi.get_mass(j)
            kinematic = rigi.get_kinematic(j)
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Rigidbodies, StaticRigidbodies

c = Controller()
resp = c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
                      c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                       position={"x": 0, "y": 3, "z": 0},
                                       object_id=c.get_unique_id()),
                      {"$type": "send_rigidbodies",
                       "frequency": "always"},
                      {"$type": "send_static_rigidbodies",
                       "frequency": "once"}])

for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "rigi":
        rigi = Rigidbodies(resp[i])
        for j in range(rigi.get_num()):
            object_id = rigi.get_id(j)
            velocity = rigi.get_velocity(j)
            angular_velocity = rigi.get_angular_velocity(j)
            sleeping = rigi.get_sleeping(j)
    elif r_id == "srig":
        srig = StaticRigidbodies(resp[i])
        for j in range(srig.get_num()):
            object_id = srig.get_id(j)
            mass = srig.get_mass(j)
            kinematic = srig.get_kinematic(j)
            dynamic_friction = srig.get_dynamic_friction(j)
            static_friction = srig.get_static_friction(j)
            bounciness = srig.get_bounciness(j)
```

## 3. Changes to avatars

### A. Adjusted `A_Simple_Body`

The bodies of `A_Simple_Body` were centered at the position of the avatar rather than halfway above. This meant that if the avatar was created at (0, 0, 0), its body would appear halfway through the floor and then "pop" up. Now, the bodies are positioned at (0, 0.5, 0) so that the avatar's pivot is at its bottom-center (just like objects in TDW).

Additionally, the cube body of `A_Simple_Body` required far more torque to turn than the other bodies. Now, it has a capsule collider, allowing it to spin easier.

## 3. Changes to controllers in the repo

### A. Removed `single_object.py`

`single_object.py` and `multi_env.py` have been removed from the repo and have been replaced with [`tdw_image_dataset`](https://github.com/alters-mit/tdw_image_dataset), a separate repo. `ImageDataset` is very similar to `SingleObject` with two notable changes:

1. It is better organized for users to create subclasses.
2. It replaces `IdPassGrayscale` data with `Occlusion` data, which is overall faster and somewhat less error prone.
