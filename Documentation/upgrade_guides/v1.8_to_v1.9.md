# How to upgrade from TDW v1.8 to v1.9

## Read the changelog

[Read this](../Changelog.md) for a complete list of changes. TDW v1.9 introduces *many* changes; this document only covers cases in which you might need to adjust existing code.

## 1. Changes to the `tdw` module

### Removed `Controller.start()`

This function used to send a command to initialize a scene in TDW. Now, that command is sent automatically in the Controller constructor.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
```

### Removed `Controller.load_streamed_scene(scene)`

This function hasn't been the preferred way to load a stream scene for a while now because it doesn't let you send additional commands on the same frame. We recommend using `Controller.get_add_scene(scene_name)` instead.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.load_streamed_scene(scene="tdw_room")
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.communicate(c.get_add_scene(scene_name="tdw_room"))
```

### Removed `Controller.add_object(model_name)`

This function hasn't been the preferred way to add an object for a while now because it doesn't let you send additional commands on the same frame. We recommend using `Controller.get_add_object(scene_name)` instead.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
object_id = c.add_object(model_name="iron_box")
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                object_id=c.get_unique_id())])
```

### Removed `check_build_process` in the `Controller` constructor

This was introduced in v1.8 and ended up not being that useful; it also slows down the controller too much to be practical.

### Replaced `DebugController` with `Debug` add-on

The `Debug` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`DebugController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.debug_controller import DebugController
c = DebugController()
c.start()
```

`Debug` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.debug import Debug

c = Controller()
c.add_ons.append(Debug(record=True, path="out"))
c.start()
```

### Replaced `KeyboardController` with `Keyboard` add-on

The `Keyboard` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`KeyboardController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.keyboard_controller import KeyboardController

def stop():
    global done
    done = True
    c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})

done = False
c = KeyboardController()
c.start()

c.listen(key="esc", function=stop)

while not done:
    c.communicate([])
```

`Keyboard` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.keyboard import Keyboard

def stop():
    global done
    done = True
    c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
    
done = False
c = Controller()
c.start()

keyboard = Keyboard()
keyboard.listen(key="esc", function=stop)
c.add_ons.append(keyboard)

while not done:
    c.communicate([])
```

## 2. Changes to the Command API

### Removed `set_proc_gen_reflection_probe`

This has been replaced with `enable_reflection_probes`.

## 3. Changes to controllers in the repo

### Removed `single_object.py`

`single_object.py` and `multi_env.py` have been removed from the repo and have been replaced with [`tdw_image_dataset`](https://github.com/alters-mit/tdw_image_dataset), a separate repo. `ImageDataset` is very similar to `SingleObject` with two notable changes:

1. It is better organized for users to create subclasses.
2. It replaces `IdPassGrayscale` data with `Occlusion` data, which is overall faster and somewhat less error prone.
